# Fine-tuning-Qwen2.5
This project takes the Qwen2.5-1.5B model and teaches it to answer like a friendly teacher would: using simple words, short sentences, and concepts that make sense to elementary school children. Through fine-tuning on child-appropriate question-answer pairs, the model learns to be both accurate and accessible.
